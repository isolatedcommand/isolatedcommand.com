#projectCodenameFortress is my dedicated home lab environment, developed to simulate and showcases how I build and manage a small-scale IT environment for personal and professional growth. It enables me to explore, learn, and innovate.

The homelab also serves as a testing ground me to do Proof-of-Concept before turning ideas into reality.
